            <p>
                Just like with any other activity, the world of coding is also governed by informal rules. Most of these
                rules are formulated over decades. Programming languages often remain in usage for longer than their founders
                expect.
            </p>

            <p>
                Programmers find innovative ways to recreate these languages for different purposes. Thus, some static
                do’s and don’ts are always of use in the fluid zone called coding. Normally, a great code has three common
                features: maintainability, dependability, and usability. It should also be adaptable enough to be efficient even
                in changing environments. However, before coding even begins, a few prerequisites need to be fulfilled in
                order to provide a solid foundation on which readable code can be written.
            </p>

            <h2>PREREQUISITES</h2>
            <ol type="1" start="1">
                <li>
                    <p>
                        This is easily the most important step of all. In absence of these, a code may be inefficient
                        even if it is completed. The prerequisites that need to be in place for an efficient code covers matters like
                        design and architecture. An important question is how development is structured. What is the specific
                        purpose of the software? The problem that the code is meant to solve must be clear to the developer. What is
                        the design of the individual components? Such basic requirements have to be fulfilled when a good code is being
                        written.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Hoare makes a good point when it comes to assessing software design and architecture. Either a code is
                        so simple that there are obviously no errors, or a code is so complex that there are no obvious errors.
                        Software design is also of importance to clients, who can decide if their needs are being adequately addressed. If
                        there are some things that architecture cannot take care of, then those are handled in the software design
                        phase. A detailed design is a good guide for coding.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>
                        The next step is to measure existing programming languages against the requirements to decide on
                        an appropriate one. If needed, a mixed routine can be adopted.
                    </p>
                </li>

            </ol>
            <p>
                Once these are met, it becomes easier to follow some established good coding practices.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>COMMENTING</h3>
                    <ol type="i" start="1">
                        <p>
                            <li>
                                Commenting is one such practice that is often ignored by programmers, especially for codes
                                that are written by multiple programmers.</li>
                            <li> However, comments reduce the cost of knowledge transfer.
                            <li> Name of the module, purpose of the module, description of the module, original author, modifications and authors who
                                modified code with a description on why it was modified were components of an early commenting practice.</li>
                        </p>
                    </ol>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>GOOD NAMING CONVENTIONS</h3>
                    <p>
                        Using good naming conventions is the next step to good coding. Often developers use Y1 or X1 as
                        variables, and then do not replace them with meaningful names. To prevent this confusion and utter waste of
                        time, descriptive names should be used.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>SIMPLICITY AND COMPACTNESS</h3>
                    <p>
                        The key to a good code is also simplicity. To achieve a certain result, developers may use complex
                        logic but this should be minimised while writing a good code. The next developer who uses the code may use
                        it for a different purpose and may not even completely understand or utilise the complex logic. Simple
                        code does not always depend on the length of the code. The code must also be conceptually simple. An added
                        advantage is if the code is also suitably compact. More code can be viewed on a page and programmer 
                        keystrokes can be reduced.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>PORTABILITY</h3>
                    <p>
                        Another feature of a good code is portability. If the code contains values referring to
                        "absolute parameters" such as file names, URLs or IP addresses, it will not run on a host that is of a different
                        design. A good programmer will parametrize these variables and configure them so the application can also be
                        run and maintained in a different environment.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>TESTING</h3>
                    <p>
                        Testing is also a necessary part in the process of coding. Test cases must be planned while the
                        code is being written, and they are developed while an application is coded.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>DEBUGGING THE CODE</h3>
                    <p>
                        While writing a code, it is necessary to check for errors throughout. Though it is fine for
                        smaller programs to be debugged after they have been written, this becomes a bottleneck for longer programmes.
                        The best practice, therefore, is to debug each module as soon as it has been created.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>DEPLOYMENT</h3>
                    <p>
                        Once the code has been written, it has to be deployed. The installation files should be kept to
                        a minimum and updated regularly. Unused code or anything that is not necessary should not be installed.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The best practices for coding are, most of all, designed to reduce risk whenever there are chances of
                it. For a beginner, a few of these will not be completely applicable. But as a hard-boiled programmer writing
                numerous codes, all these guidelines will come in handy. Since codes can run up to millions of lines at times,
                outdated advice like "keep it simple" or "less is more" is priceless and should always be remembered.
